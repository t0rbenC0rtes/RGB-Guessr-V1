# RGB-Guessr-V1
RGB guessing game in native js. WORK IN PROGRESS !!!

This small project was inspired by (https://susam.net/myrgb.html).
Go check his work, it's much better than mine. It's all open source too.

My js is a mess. I was experimenting a lot and finally somehow got it to work.
Next version will be improved with :
- cleaner and more readable code
- "new game" button, each game consisting of 3 rounds. Lowest score wins.
- leaderboard
- UI that doesn't make your eyes bleed
